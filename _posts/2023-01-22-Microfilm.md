The Youth Media Center at the School of Artificial Intelligence has produced its first campus microfilm, *Carpe Diem*, which is now available on WeChat Video Channel and Bilibili. I am honored to have served as the screenwriter and male lead, as well as participating in the singing of the end song and the post-production of the audio. Everyone is welcome to watch and interact with us!
