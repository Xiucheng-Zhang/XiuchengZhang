My first HCI research project, DesignWatch, was accepted by MobileHCI 2024 LBW, providing me with the opportunity to attend an academic conference for the first time. I would like to thank Prof. Peng for his guidance and all my collaborators for their hard work. I was very fortunate to make many friends in Melbourne. It was an immensely rewarding experience!
