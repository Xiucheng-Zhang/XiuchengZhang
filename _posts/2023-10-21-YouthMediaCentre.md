I am delighted to welcome fresh faces to the Youth Media Center this new semester and to have selected a new leadership team. During the interviews, I saw the talents of our new members and am confident they will produce even more impressive works in the future. I will no longer serve as the president, and I am grateful for the support from teachers and fellow students over the past year.
