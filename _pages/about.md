Hello! I'm Xiucheng Zhang (Âº†‰øÆÁ®ã), a senior student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Sun Yat-sen University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhenhui Peng](https://www.zhenhuipeng.com/), who led me into Human-Computer Interaction research. In summer 2024, I was a visiting research intern at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and very honored to work with [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/). I am set to graduate in June 2025 and **am actively seeking opportunities for further study following my undergraduate degree**.

My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI for Creativity. Specifically, my focus includes: 
1. Understanding and simulating human cognition to align the minds of humans and intelligent agents, thereby optimizing the experience of human-machine collaboration.
2. Exploring the imagination of intelligent agents to assist humans in creative tasks, such as image design, video production, music creation, etc.

Overall, I am passionate about considering the role of AI from the perspective of a partner or friend, and the support they can offer us (I am a huge fan of Jarvis). I also look forward to utilizing more research opportunities in the future to further refine and clarify my research direction.

Besides my experience in HCI, I have also had the privilege to work with [Prof. Juepeng Zheng](https://rssysu.github.io/assets/resume/zjp.html) on remote sensing and computer vision research. Additionally, I have completed internships as an algorithm engineer in Shenzhen and Shanghai. Outside of academia, I am passionate about artistic work, such as video and music creation (Welcome to explore more of me through my Blog). I am very eager to integrate these interests into my future research direction.
